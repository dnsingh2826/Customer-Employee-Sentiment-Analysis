# Customer-Employee-Sentiment-Analysis

This is a web scraping & sentiment analysis project, testing my python skills like scraping websites using BeautifulSoup4 and automation using Selenium. I also made a custom NLP model to process texts from the scraped data. 

Description - The code, first asks for a company name (EY), using which it will scrape all the public reviews about the company available on the internet via Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Entrackr, Indeed etc. posted their by the employees of the company and the customers as well. Once all the reviews are scraped, it runs a custom ML model on the scraped text to find the sentiments of the reviews and classify them into Positive, Neutral and Negative reviews. Then, an automated Power BI dashboard is made using the analyzed data. This dashboard can be used by investors to review the public image of the company and make an informed decision to whether invest or not in the company.
