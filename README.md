Websites Scraping
- Some websites like indeed & linkedin may ask for mobile number verification if the code is executed too frequently in a short interval. 
- The address (XPATH) of elements on Glassdoor's website change frequently. One might have to change the xpath in that case manually in future. 
- Websites like Facebook and Entrackr may provide some irrelevant reviews because of the method of search these websites use. These websites do not have an advanced search feature as well.

Although frequent ads might hinder user experience but should be working fine.
